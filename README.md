# Group 15 Rainfall Analysis Ensemble Machine Learning Model (DSCI 525)

## Overview 

This project is focused on building and deploying an ensemble machine learning model in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia. The features are outputs of different climate models and the target is the actual rainfall observation. 

## Dataset

The dataset used can be found on figshare [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681).
