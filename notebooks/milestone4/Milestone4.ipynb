Read [this](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/) to learn more on ```screen```.\n",
    "10. Now, create a new `screen` session (think of this as a new, separate shell), using: `screen -S myapi`. If you want to list already created sessions do ```screen -list```. If you want to get into an existing ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "11. Within that session, start up your flask app. You can then exit the session by pressing `Ctrl + A then press D`. Here you are detaching the session, once you log back into EC2 instance you can attach it using ```screen -x myapi```.\n",

    "- Milestone 1\n",
    "> We found out working with large datasets locally using the standard library (Pandas) was not efficient due to high time and memory usage. Besides, the local system might crash due to insufficient resources (low configurations). Then we learned to use fligshare API to download data remotely and extract the zip file programmatically. We noticed that changing the data types of the columns from float64 to float32 could help reduce memory usage while performing columnwise operations, however, had no obvious impact on runtime since there was no parallel computing being done. Finally, we explored Dask approach as an alternative to Pandas, which allowed us to load and process data in chunks and performed parallel computing. As a result, the memory usage and runtime were significantly reduced. In addition, we compared memory usage and runtime while converting the data into other file formats such as parquet, arrow and feather for a simple EDA. We ended up using parquet format as it consumed the least memory as compared to other formats and was easy to work with when transferring data from python to R kernel within the same notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Milestone 2\n",
    "> In this milestone we set up our EC2 instance with JupyterHub and ensured that all of our members could access it. We also installed all the necessary packages required for running the code we would use in our instance; this included basic packages such as `pandas` and `sklearn`. With our JupyterHub `ipynb` equipped to run the code provided by Gittu we were then able to download the data in a parquet file format by running code provided. From there we set up our S3 bucket and moved the data that we obtained from Milestone 1 along with the parquet file obtained earlier to the S3 bucket. Lastly, we did a bit of data wrangling while working with the data from S3 and saved the processed file back to S3. Overall, it was relatively smooth sailing this milestone. However, we did have to spend some time figuring out how to move the parquet file to s3 which we ultimately were able to do by adding `--recursive` to our command.\n",
    "- Milestone 3\n",
    "> In Milestone 3, we spun up an EMR cluster in AWS, which allows us to scale out using distributed computing with PySpark framework. We first used The Littlest JupyterHub(TLJH) in our EC2 instance to read in the data stored in our S3 bucket, split into train and test sets, and perform basic EDA on the train set. Then, we used PySpark machine learning libraries on our EMR cluster to conduct a grid search for best-performing hyperparameters for `RandomForestRegressor`. Using PySpark allows the machine learning tasks during training and cross-validation to be distributed. Since hyperparameter search on this large dataset can be very computationally expensive and have demanding memory requirements, scale out solution with PySpark using distributed computing can be very helpful. Then, using these best-performing hyperparameter values, we trained a final model in our EC2 instance and saved the model in S3 bucket as a \"model.joblib\" file that is ready for deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Milestone 4\n",
    "> In this milestone, we deployed the best `RandomForestRegressor` model in a production environment hosted in the EC2 instance that can be accessed by others using a REST API. To make the API, we built a simple Flask web framework. We created `app.py` script as the `FLASK_APP` environment variable. In this `app.py` script, two functions bound with the `@app.route()` decorator are created. The `index` function is just for the landing/index page which can be accessed by HTTP `GET` method. The other function `rainfall_prediction` defines a new route which will accept POST requests and return model predictions based on user's input. Finally, we run the Flask application in the `screen` session which we created to make our service persist even though we exit the connection wit the EC2 instance."
